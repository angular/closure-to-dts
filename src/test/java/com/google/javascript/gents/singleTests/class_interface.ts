// This file contains a mix of different ways of declaring an interface with
// methods and properties in Closure. The only commonality is that the user
// meant to write an interface, and attached it to an ES6 class out of
// convenience.
// Fields and methods are declared in three different ways:
// - in the ctor body
// - class body
// - using the prototype chain.
// Extending mechanism is both ES6 'class extends', and closure @extends.
